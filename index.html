                      <h1>Welcome to the BioSite of Eddie Agosto Garcia<br>The Man, The Myth, The Legend.</h1>



                    <div id="welcome">

                      <h3>Eddie is a, Christian, Father, Husband, Business Owner, Patriot and Military Veteran.</h3>

                      <p>Eddie is 43, He is a friend I made at the shooting range. He has a
                      funny sense of humor, and loves to joke around. He is an excellent firearms instructor who taught my 18 year old daughter
                      to shoot. </p>

                    </div>

                    <div id="bio">

                      <p>Eddie joined the Military when he was 26, before that he worked as A CNA at a hospital,
                        that is where he met his wife. He joined the military after they got engaged. They have been married for 11 years
                        and have one daughter together who's name is Isabella. </p>

                      <p>The coolest thing about Eddie is his story of how he became a Christian after getting out of the military.
                        Eddie struggled with substance abuse, drinking, anger, fighting and was just a really hard guy to get along with.
                        That all changed when he met Jesus, God healed Eddie of all these things. If you met Eddie today you would never know
                        he struggled with these things unless he told you. God also saved Eddie and Natasha's marriage as his bad behavior was
                        proving to be troublesome for Natasha. Eddie is an open book about all this and gives God the glory for all He has done
                        for Natasha and him.
                      </p>

                      <p>The Second coolest thing about Eddies is he loves to shoot guns. He is up for going to the shooting range any
                        time he can. Natasha also loves to shoot, together they have all kinds of cool guns.
                      </p>
