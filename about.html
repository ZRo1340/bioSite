          <p>"The army started at 26. Before that, I was a terrible student. I made it to ninth grade and then got kicked out before the first semester because of fighting. I left school around age 16. After I quit high school, I had been working odd jobs for a few years, when I decided I should get my education going. So at 20 I went to a job core in Miami, and that's where I met my first wife Christina. Come to think of it I never did graduate job core either because I got kicked out. Then I moved to Fort Lauderdale because that is where Cristina’s parents live. Me and Christina moved in together and she ended up getting pregnant. That's when I decided I should probably go back to school. So I got my GED. Shortly after getting my GED me and Christina broke up. We were just too young when we got together, and all this started happening. After my relationship ended with Christina I decided that I was going to go be a CNA, so I went to a different job core and got a license to be a CNA. Once I graduated and got my CNA license I started working at a hospital in Titusville, Florida. That's where I met Natasha my current wife. She was already a nurse and when I took the job Natasha became my boss, so technically, I married my boss. Shortly after that is when I joined the army. In the Army I went infantry where basic training sucked. I did my first term in El Paso, Texas at Fort Bliss. After basic training I was trying to go to border patrol but that did not work out so I decided to reinlist for another 4 years in the Army. I stayed in El Paso, and Natasha and I bought a house.
            Then in 2017, I deployed to Afghanistan from January to October. When I got back, I got promoted to sergeant. And then as soon as I got familiar with being a sergeant, they said it's time for you to get a broadening assignment, so they made me a recruiter. I went to recruiting school in Fort Knox. I then got assigned to Mount Pleasant, Michigan where I live now. I was an army recruiter for two years more or less. Recruiting is like way more relaxed than the infantry. So as I slowly started not to work out as hard and run as much, I started to realize my body was falling apart. I actually needed to get a back surgery because I blew out one of my discs when in active duty. You can’t be in the army with blowen disks in your back so I started the medical process of getting out of the army and became 100% disabled. Even though I could still technically work, according to the Army I was 100% disabled. Right before I got out of the Army completely I started a small cleaning business cleaning the recruiting office that I was in. This came about because the cleaners weren't coming back after covid. From small beginnings cleaning the recruiting office my business exploded to a fulltime cleaning business that kept growing and growing. That is how my cleaning business, Mr. Clean, was born. The business ended up being so good and so much work that my wife Natasha quit her job of being a nurse to come work for the cleaning business and we've been doing that ever since."
