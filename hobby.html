          <p>Here is a picture of just some of the guns that Eddie Brings to the shooting range. The other pictures
            are of Eddie teaching my kids, Hannah and Eli to shoot. I also shoot a lot with Eddie, he has taught me a lot
            over the past months. He is very encouraging, but will never turn down a challenge to compete against me on the
            shooting tree.
